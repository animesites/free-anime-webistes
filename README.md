# How to use
Send your request to the server with the port 3000 and add your URL to the "url" query string like this:
`http://localhost:3000/?url=https://example.org`

This script has been configured to wait for the cloudflare challenge to pass but, you can configure the "match" for anything else using the environment variable `CHALLENGE_MATCH`.  
If the website that you are targeting have a protection page with "please wait" in the HTML code then launch the script like this:
```
CHALLENGE_MATCH="please wait" npm start
```

To show the browser window, set the environment variable `PUPPETEER_HEADFUL=1`.

To use a proxy,
set the `PUPPETEER_PROXY` environment variable, for example `PUPPETEER_PROXY=localhost:8080`.

To specify user data directory, set `PUPPETEER_USERDATADIR=/path/to/dir`.
